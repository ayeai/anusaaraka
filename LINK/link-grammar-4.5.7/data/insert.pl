# Dictionary maintenance tool - insert words into dictionary.
# Given a list of words and a dictionary file, this script
# will insert the words into the file, in alphabetical order,
# with a minimum of disruption of the file itself.
#
# It is assumed that the word-list holds one word per line,
# and that the word-list is already in alphabetical order.
#
# Example usage:
# ./insert.pl wordlist_file en/words/words.adj.1
